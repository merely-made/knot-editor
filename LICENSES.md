# Licenses in this repository

**This repository: MPL-2.0.** Every file Mark wrote carries Exhibit A and the
SPDX tag `MPL-2.0`, per the
[license posture brief](design_docs/2026-08-22_license_posture_brief.md) of
2026-08-22. The full text is in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

This file is the provenance ledger. It is the authority for what the relicense
tool skips: `scripts/relicense_headers.py` reads the backtick-quoted paths
below and never touches them. Provenance comes before license — a file gets
Exhibit A only if Mark wrote it.

## Retained licenses

Third-party code keeps its own license and its own notices. Nothing here is
relicensed, and nothing here receives a Merely copyright line.

| Path | License | Upstream | Notice files |
|---|---|---|---|
| `support/patches/cubecl-runtime` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | [tracel-ai/cubecl](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl) | `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE` in-tree |
| `support/patches/cubecl-wgpu` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | [tracel-ai/cubecl](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl) | `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE` in-tree |
| `support/patches/cubek-reduce` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | [tracel-ai/cubecl](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl) | `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE` in-tree |
| `support/patches/burn-cubecl` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | [tracel-ai/burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) | upstream's |
| `support/patches/burn-remote` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | [tracel-ai/burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) | upstream's |

384 tracked files. These are vendored patch trees consumed through
`[patch]`; they are upstream's work carrying upstream's terms.

## Derivatives carrying MPL-2.0 with an upstream notice retained

These are **not** skipped. Each file receives Exhibit A and Mark's copyright
line, and every upstream copyright line above it is kept verbatim. Apply with
`--retain-notice`, which preserves foreign copyright lines while replacing
Mark's own.

| Path | Upstream | Notices kept |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/system/luggage` | [cargo-packager-updater](https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/cargo-packager), MIT OR Apache-2.0 | `Copyright 2019-2023 Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy`; `Copyright 2023-2023 CrabNebula Ltd.` |

Ruled 2026-08-27, on the brief's substantial-derivative precedent: tucket keeps
MeshCore's MIT notice, and cambium and meristem go MPL-2.0 with the Apache
notice retained. Both MIT and Apache-2.0 permit relicensing a derivative so
long as the notice travels with it. luggage is published (0.1.0, MIT OR
Apache-2.0); that version keeps its grant permanently and MPL-2.0 ships at its
next functional bump, per the sweep plan's invariant 8.

**This section is deliberately not the skip list.** The tool reads only the
`## Retained licenses` table above. Adding a path here documents a disposition;
it does not exempt the path from receiving a header.

## Exceptions under the fork/vendor criterion

**None.** The brief's §4 test — a crate stays MIT OR Apache-2.0 only when a
third party would need to *modify or vendor* it rather than merely link it —
admits nothing in this repository. `illume`, `buckram`, `errand` and `tinct`
were each proposed and declined on 2026-08-22.

If one is ever granted, its manifest says `MIT OR Apache-2.0` explicitly with a
comment naming the brief, and it is listed here.

## How to add a file from elsewhere

1. Do not delete or rewrite the upstream copyright or license notice, ever.
2. Add its path to **Retained licenses** above with its license, upstream URL,
   and where its notice text lives. The tool then skips it automatically.
3. If it is a substantial derivative rather than a verbatim import, the brief's
   rule is MPL-2.0 on the derivative *with the upstream notice retained* —
   record it here with that disposition so the distinction is not lost.
4. Never add `license-file` to an owned manifest; the field is for retained
   third-party crates only.
5. Re-run `python scripts/relicense_headers.py --audit` and confirm the owned
   source count moved by exactly what you expected.

## A note on the discovery grep

The sweep plan's invariant 1 lists `Copyright (c)` among its discovery
patterns. That form is not universal: `crates/system/luggage` writes bare
`Copyright 2019-2023 <holder>` with no parenthesised `(c)`, and was missed by
the plan's own pattern set on 2026-08-27. Discovery should grep for
`Copyright` unqualified, then read the hits.
